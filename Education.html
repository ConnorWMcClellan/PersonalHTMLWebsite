					While other courses such as History, English, and the Humanities
					<br>are intersting. I am truly looking forward to focusing on more 
					<br>technical courses. These are the courses that I find the most 
					<br>engaging and enjoyable. These type of courses include 
					<br>Programming courses, Computer Systems courses, 
					<br>Machine Learning, Mathematics, and Physics as well as Chemistry.

					During my time at Lindenwood, I plan on obtaining two minors 
					<br>to compliment my BS in Computer Science. I am heavily 
					<br>considering Data Science as my first minor as it also 
					<br>involves machine learning, which I find very interesting. 
					<br>For the second minor, I'm trying to decide between 
					<br>Web Design or Game Design. I hope the next two semesters 
					<br>will help me make up my mind.
