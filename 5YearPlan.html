					For the next 3 years, I will be completing 
					<br>my BS degree in Computer Science with 
					<br>a minor in Web Design and Data Science.
					<br>In the next 2 years, I hope to participate
					<br>in an internship for my Major at either
					<br>Boeing or another respected local tech company. 
					<br>Following my Gradutaion in May of 2023, I 
					<br>expect to get a job in Software Devolpment
					<br>with Machine Learning. My preference would
					<br>be to have a job locally in St. Louis, MO 
					<br>with, hopefully, Boeing.

				<h3>
					For years 4-5 I hoped to be working as a Software 
					<br>Developer for either simulators or software 
					<br>used for fighter aircraft such as the F-18  
					<br>Super Hornet, F-15 Strike Eagle, or F-22
					<br>Raptor. Alternatives would be working with 
					<br>the design team for T-7A trainer or at  
					<br>Boeings Weapons Systems Facility.
