				<h4>
					Hi!, I'm Connor McClellan. 
					<br>I am currently a sophmore at Lindenwood University
					<br>majoring in Computer Science.The reason I chose 
					<br>Computer Science is that I come from a very techincal 
					<br>family. My great grandfather designed hydro electric 
					<br>power plants, my grandfather is a mechnaical & 
					<br>electrical builder, and my father is chemical engineer. 
					<br>I enjoy all computer and engineering disciplines.

					I also have interests in Web Design and Data Science. Devoloping my skills as a web 
					<br>designer will allow me to create my own websites and expand my knowledge of 
					<br>computer related careers. One discipline of Data Science that really peaks my interest
					<br>is Machine Learning. Machine Learning combines my love of Computer Science and
					<br>Mathematics into one.
